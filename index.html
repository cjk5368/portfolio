                    Hello everyone! My name is Christian Koski and I am from Ashtabula, Ohio.
                    I am a recent graduate of Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's in Game Design and
                    Development. Here I accumulated
                    the skills necessary to thrive in the computer science field, and to feel inspired to create and
                    develop
                    whatever interactive games and media I am able to envision. In the near future, I would love to work
                    in
                    an atmosphere of creativity
                    and camaraderie, wherein everyone plays a role in designing and developing the lucrative titles of
                    the future gaming industry.

                        You receive a peculiar phone call from a mother asking for your help. Her baby has stopped
                        responding and showing emotion, but doctors can't find anything wrong with them. She begs for
                        any help she can get to figure out what is wrong with her child. As you get into a cab to the
                        family’s apartment, you wonder if your powers of dream-walking can help.

                    movement, media players, and UI/UX design. Note: The project is not intended for distribution due to

                    ChangelingVR is a VR first-person interactive mystery built upon the ideas of magical realism and a
                    sense of unease and wonder. You play as a detective named Aurelia, a dream-walker whose gift is the
                    ability to see the thoughts and memories of anyone she touches. This gift makes you a family's last
                    resort in figuring out what is wrong with their baby. As you make contact with each family member,
                    you will see through the lens of their hopes and fears what is left of the baby. I worked on this
                    project in the Spring of 2023 as a Gameplay Programmer, Level Designer, and Technical Artist for the
                    Father's Level.

                    The Lonely Island was designed as a distributable Skyrim quest mod using Creation Kit in a team of
                    five for a semester-long modding seminar. I was tasked with level design and asset implementation,
                    and was responsible for researching the Creation Engine and Papyrus Scripting Language to
                    iteratively progress successive prototypes with developing expertise.

                    Blood Eagle was created as a semester-long project to design and implement role-playing game systems
                    and concepts into a distributable product published on DriveThruRPG. I worked as the Lead
                    Playtester, tasked with implementing internal and external feedback and creating a balanced gameplay
                    environment within provided guidelines.

                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to create an interactive, multi-camera, Human vs Zombies experience
                    within the Unity Engine over a one-month time frame. I achieved this goal by implementing vector
                    forces and managing autonomous
                    agents. Humans evade zombies, and zombies pursue humans. The player can shoot zombies from either a
                    first person or overhead view. I created this experience with accumulated methods of collision
                    checking, force-driven movement, and asset creation.
