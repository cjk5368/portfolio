        <h2>Portfolio Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I am intending for this portfolio to grab the attention of employers, enabling them to see both who I am
                and what I have been learning during my time at RIT.
            </li>
            <li>
                My idea was for this portfolio to be aligned with the requirements for this project while still
                maintaining a unique experience for site visitors.
            </li>
            <li>
                I would like to include a CSS flexbox and grid to organize and optimize my content, a scrolling
                navigation to move around the page, links to relevant contact information, and images meant to showcase
                my prior or upcoming work.
            </li>
            <li>
                My content will be organized with a one-page layout in mind. Every component on my page will be flexible
                to accommodate mobile devices. My external stylesheet will accomplish all of my style choices and
                possible corrections. Both my HTML and CSS will need to pass validation as well.
            </li>

        <h2>Design Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I attempted to make good use of borders and horizontal rules to make both section divisions and images
                pop-out for the viewer of my portfolio.
            </li>
            <li>
                One of the critiques that I received was to make a “dark mode” for my website, featuring darker
                backgrounds and lighter text. After I incorporated this design, I realized how much more appealing my
                website will be for night time viewers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another suggestion was for me to make my navigation button scroll to their respective sections, which
                helps promote a smooth flow of content as opposed to more “jumpy” page links.
            </li>
            <li>
                I made sure to make my margins and padding consistent to help in my repetition of similar content
                sections. Viewers will hopefully appreciate that my portfolio possesses consistent spacing and makes
                efficient use of a single-page layout.
            </li>
            <li>
                Although the text for the project section is currently filler, I took care in making sure the formatting
                matches the rest of the neighboring content. I did this by making the entire section a CSS grid, but the
                interior subsections a flexbox container. This gives me the benefits of an adjustable container, while
                interior pieces stay connected to one another regardless of size.
            </li>
            <li>
                My resume is a PDF embedded within the page. I used the embed tag in combination with an image tag to
                accomplish this.
            </li>
            <li>
                I desired to be consistent in my use of colors, so I adhered to a strict scheme throughout the web page.
                This does not include images used to identify my project, but possibly could in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
                Image dimensions were definitely considered for making my page. Every image is under 500kb, and is
                resized through CSS to fit its container.
            </li>
            <li>
                Future updates will include but are not limited to the following: substitute placeholder sections with
                actual GDD projects, incorporate additional media (video and game demos) into project sections, add more
                information about myself as more opportunities arise, add links to future projects or other noteworthy
                information for my portfolio, and resize all images to occupy reasonable file space.
            </li>
